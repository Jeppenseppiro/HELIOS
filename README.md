 Geographical Information System (GIS) for the LEYECO V electrical company

A/an (incomplete/scuffed) geographical information system made for an electrical company here in Leyte. One of the reasons why this was made was because during the 2013 super typhoon Yolanda, record-keeping and fetching of the properties (ex. electrical posts, transformers) was a nightmare. Automating that process was one solution to the problem.
